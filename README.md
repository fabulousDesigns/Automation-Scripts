# Automation Scripts
A  collection of automation scripts designed to streamline and enhance various tasks and workflows. Includes scripts for system administration, data processing, task scheduling, and more. Ideal for improving efficiency and reducing manual effort.

### push_to_docker_hub.sh
The script will prompt you to enter the `Docker image name(your dockerhub repository name)`, tag, `Docker Hub username`, and `password`. It will then build the `Docker image`, log in to Docker Hub, and push the image to Docker Hub. 
Run the script using the following command: 

```bash 
  sudo chmod +x push_to_docker_hub.sh && ./push_to_docker_hub.sh
```
Customize it the way you like.
